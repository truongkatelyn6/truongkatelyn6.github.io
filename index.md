I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 2 
This was my favorite lab because I believe it was a good introduction to the basics of coding. The cloning was good practice because we continued to use it for all the other labs as well. I had no coding experience before this and this lab made it easy to understand and the steps were thorough. 

Lab 4 
This lab was another one of my favorites. This is because this lab was more of a real life situation. At first I was confused on this specific topic but my partner was able to explain it to me. We had a lot of practice declaring and initializing a double variable. I liked testing the code and seeing the measurements come out correctly. 

Lab 11 (Part 2)
I enjoyed this lab because we created a guessing game. We used what we learned in lecture and I saw how random numbers could be used in an actual example. My partner also worked very well with me. When compiling this we had many errors but were able to use our notes to fix them in a timely manner.
